description: First published in English in 1921, this work was originally written
  by renowned Marxist historian Max Beer to commemorate the centenary of Marx's birth.

  comprehensive account of Marx's economic and historical doctrines A special feature
  of this unique work is the new light thrown on Marx's attitude to the ""Dictatorship
  of the Proletariat"" and Bolshevist methods generally.
